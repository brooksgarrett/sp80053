# sp80053
The NIST 800-53 XML files with various modifications. Most notably, all FedRAMP assignments.

# Purpose
Currently all FedRAMP guidance is provided in the templates. Moving assignments and guidance into the XML format allows for 
better machine parsing of this data and inclusion into other tools.

## ToDo

Add all additional guidance and requirements. Currently only assignments are done.

# Status
Currently tracking the [800-53 Rev 4 Source XML](http://nvd.nist.gov/static/feeds/xml/sp80053/rev4/800-53-controls.xml).
